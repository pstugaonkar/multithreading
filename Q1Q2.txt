Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the differene between Exceptions and Syntex errors.
'''
'''ANSWER'''
'''
Exception is error that occurs during the execution of a program.
Exception error occurs when there is wrong input, or file is not found due to any reason
or incorrect attribute or division by zero. Such errors disturbs the flow of program
any code written after such error codes will not be executed. We can use try-except
method to handle such exceptions.

Syntax error is caused when code is not written correctly for example, not completing quotes"" or ''
while enetring string. There is no provision of handling syntax code, we need to correct our code in such type of errors.

'''
Q2. What happens when as exception is not handled? explain with an example.
'''
'''ANSWER'''
'''
When exception is not handled system will show an error
and code after that will not be executed.
Python executes code line by line therefore, it will not execute any code after the error.
Therefore, exception handling is necessary to smooth running of our program.
'''

try:
    print(z)
except:
    print("This is name error")
    
'''
When exception is handled above code will run and give result, followed to running of below 
code, which will show error as exception is not handled
'''
print("Here 'z' is not defined hence it is going to show name error")
print(z)
