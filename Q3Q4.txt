'''
Q3. Which python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? 
explain with an example.
'''
'''ANSWER'''
'''
'try' and 'except' statements are used to catch and handle exceptions
For example'''
try:
    num = int(input("numerator"))
    den = int(input("denominator"))
    div = num/den
    print("result",div)
except Exception as e :
    print("Check the input",e)
    
print('program is completed')

'''As we have handled exceptions last command is able to complete in all cases.
Here, we imported class 'Exception' so that it will print the error along with
given string in except code block.
'''
'''
Q4. Explain with an example:
a. try and else
b. finally
c. raise
'''
'''ANSWER'''
'''
a. try and else
try and else are used as keywords for exception handeling. try takes the argument
for which exception need to be handled. when try statement shows exception, except statement
will be run. If no exception arise in try statement then else statement is executed.
'''
try:
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    add = x+y
except Exception as e :
    print("There is error",e)
    
else:
    print("addition is",add)

'''
b. finally
finally statement is used when certain code is supposed to be executed irrespective
of try-except is successfully run or not.
statement under 'finally' will be run everytime.
'''

try:
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    multi = x*y
except Exception as e :
    print("There is error",e)
    
else:
    print("Multiplication is",multi)
finally:
    print("operation is complete")
